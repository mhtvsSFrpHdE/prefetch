JUST DON'T BOTHER ME PUBLIC LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2019 mhtvsSFrpHdE

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "source code").

This special license is based on MIT and WTFPL, and named as JDBM license (just don't bother me).
It is equivalent to MIT license (protecting source code maintainers) but has extra permission directly granted to "you" (the "developers who can choose to use source code").
It nearly releases the source code to the public domain, but keep version management ability to source code maintainers,
and free them from legal responsibilities and consequences.

MIT requires you to include the copyright notice and the permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the "Software".
WTFPL granted you to do almost anything include commercial use but does not protect maintainers from legal responsibilities and consequences.
To combine both of the advantages, JDBM and you agreed to:

- You do not have to tell the "source code usage" on the product's user interface or any text shown to end-user, either JDBM and MIT.
  The license files do not have to put in a conspicuous position like the executable file in the root install folder.
  That means, the license files just need to be included in final distribute program files and a meaningful file name, but no matter how if you hide it from end-users.
  Treat it as an "agreement between developers" and have nothing to do with the end-users.
  If no license provided in final distribute, the source code considered as your results of the work.
  In this case, the source code behavior has nothing to do with source code maintainers.

- Any responsibilities and consequences must not have a relationship with the source code maintainers.
  The person who decided to use source code must take any responsibility and consequences.
  You are not entitled to any accident compensation from the source code maintainers.

- You are not granted to make a copy of the source code, apply for patent rights and sue the source code maintainers.

- You did can use the source code for any purpose, but keep in mind if anything happens, "just don't bother me".

All of the above terms must be agreed to use the licensed source code.
If you disagree with the terms, stop the plan to use the source code and remove any local changes.
And contact the source maintainers if you still wish to negotiate with.
